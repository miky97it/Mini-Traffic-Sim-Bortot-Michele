This repo is just a small program written in java to test my knowledge about OOP for Engage Process

In Runnable there is the program ready to run

I chose to use the class mean instead of an interface Imean and a class Car.
This allow me to manage airplane, Truck and car all together in the ArrayList means casting them to mean, and then if needed I can cast them back to the derived class to use the dummy methods (like when I print a truck)
